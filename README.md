## Goal of this repository

This repository contains a collection of beginner projects for the ESP32 and Arduino. I will update this repository as I learn new things and create new projects.

In the ressources folder you will find the schematics and the bill of materials for the projects. If I am using tutorials or code from the internet I will link them in the README of the project and in the ressources folder.
